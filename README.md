# ML Playground: Exploring Machine Learning Concepts

## Project Overview
This repository is a collection of machine learning projects, experiments, and research tasks that I work on in my free time. The goal is to explore various ML techniques, implement state-of-the-art models, and build useful tools while improving my skills in machine learning, deep learning, and data science.

## Objectives
- Implement ML algorithms from scratch to understand their inner workings.
- Work on real-world datasets and solve practical problems.
- Experiment with deep learning models and optimize their performance.
- Explore NLP, computer vision, and other AI subfields.
- Build small, modular projects that can be reused in larger applications.


## Planned Projects & Experiments 
- **Supervised Learning**
    - Regression and classification problems.
    - Feature engineering and model selection.
    - Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearch and RandomSearch.
- **Unsupervised Learning**
    - Clustering techniques (K-Means, DBSCAN, etc.).
    - Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP).
- **Semi-supervised Learning**
    - Combining labeled and unlabeled data for model improvement.
    - Exploring self-training and pseudo-labelling techniques.
- **Deep Learning**
    - Neural networks using TensorFlow/PyTorch.
    - CNNs for image classification.
    - RNNs and transformers for NLP tasks.
- **NLP Experiments**
    - Sentiment analysis, text classification, named entity recognition.
    - Implementing attention mechanisms and transformers
    - Exploring pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT, GPT).
- **Reinforcement Learning**
    - Implement basic RL algorithms.
    - Train an agent to solve a simple environment.

## Projects Done
- **Movie Genre Classification**: Train a model to determine the genre of any movie based on description of the movie using supervised learning.

## Technology
