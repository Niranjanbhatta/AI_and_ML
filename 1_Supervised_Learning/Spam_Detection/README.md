<h1 align="center">ðŸ“©ðŸš«Spam Detection</h1>

<p align="justify">
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that detects whether the messeges are spam or not based on their label and messages. The model utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict whether the message are spam of ham.

<h2 align="center">ðŸš€ Key Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Text Preprocessing:</b> The data undergoes preprocessing steps like removing unnecessary values from the dataset for model training.</li>
    <li><b>Model Training:</b> A TF-IDF vectorizer is combined with Logistic Regression to build the classification model.</li>
    <li><b>Evaluation Metrics:</b> Model performance is assessed using accuracy score and a classification report.</li>
    <li><b>Pipeline Saving:</b> The trained model, along with the vectorizer, is saved as a pickle file in the <code>Model_Trained</code> directory.</li>
</ul>
