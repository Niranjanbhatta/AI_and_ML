<h1 align="center">🧠 Unsupervised Learning</h1>

<p align="justify">
Unsupervised learning is a crucial machine learning technique where models learn patterns and structures from unlabeled data. Instead of relying on predefined outputs, these models identify hidden structures and groupings within the dataset. This approach is widely used in applications such as customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction.
